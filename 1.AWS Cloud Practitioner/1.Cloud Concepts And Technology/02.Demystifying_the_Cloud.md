# Demystifying the Cloud

## 1. Mode of Using AWS services

A user can access AWS services in two ways, either AWS Console: AWS console is a GUI which gives access to the AWS services or API access: API access is a problematical interaction with AWS services.

## Scalability

The ability to easily grow in size, capacity, and/or scope when required (usually based on demand). Scalability is achieved by adding resources on demand to accommodate growth.

## Elasticity

The ability to not only grow (scale) when required but also reduce in size when required. Elasticity is achieved by adding resources on demand to accommodate the growth and remove the resources when not required.

## High Availability

The ability to withstand a certain amount of failure and still remain functional (and/or be self-healing and return to full capacity). High availability is the ability of a system to remain in an operational state for a long period of time. Highly available systems are able to stay operational during maintenance and system failures.

## Fault Tolerance

The concept of something being accessible when you attempt to access it (ans/or the ability to access something via multiple platforms). When an environment is fault tolerant, it is able to withstand the loss of a component within the infrastructure while remaining functional.
