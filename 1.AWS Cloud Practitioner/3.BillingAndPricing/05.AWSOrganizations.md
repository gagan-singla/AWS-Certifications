Best practices:

    1. Always enable multi-factor authentication on root account
    2. Always have strong and complex password on root account.
    3. Paying account should be used for billing purposes only. Do not deploy resources into the paying account.

Linked Accounts:
    1. 20 linked accounts only.
    2. To add more, refer to AWS resource section.

Billing alerts:
    1. When monitoring is enabled on the paying account, the billing data for all linked accounts is included.
    2. You can still create billing alerts per individual account.

CloudTrail:

    1. Turn on CloudTrail in paying account.
    2. Create a bucket policy that allows cross-account access.
