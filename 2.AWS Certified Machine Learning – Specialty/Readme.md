## My experience in passing AWS Certified Machine Learning - Specialty 2020 Exam in first attempt

I passed AWS Certified Machine Learning Specialty certification exam today [Dated: May/21/2020]. It was my first attempt and the exam was not easy to be very honest. I am so happy to have this certification under my belt.

Few questions which I have not seen in any training videos/practice papers/AWS training materials/AWS White Papers/AWS Documentation:

1. Given a Residual plot and asked about variance and linear learner model performance
2. Given a Histogram plot and asked what feature engineering needed.
3.INVERSE CONFUSION MATRIX i.e. Predicted values at top and Actual values at side (3-questions referencing Confusion Matrix)

Other questions were mostly around below topics:

1. Quite a lot of questions on choosing right Machine Learning and Deep Learning algorithms based on given scenario (eg. ClickStream data analysis, Fraud detection, Anomaly detection etc)
2. 2-3 questions on Use of Docker container to build custom ML algorithms
8-12 questions on Kinesis services
3. 12-15 questions on combination of AWS services (AWS Glue, S3,Kinesis family, Lambda, Polly, Lex, Transcribe, SageMaker etc)
4. 2-3 questions on ML Security
5. 2-5 questions on using Bag Of Words, N-Gram, Tf-Idf, word embeddings (word2vec)
6. 2-3 questions on document analysis/text analysis
7. 1 question on calculating Shards
8. 1 question on calculating Model Accuracy
9. 1 question on Poisson distribution
